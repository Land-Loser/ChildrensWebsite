        <h2>Chapter 31</h2>

        <br>

        <p>I woke up the next day completely cured. I thought a bathe would do me a lot of good, and so went and plunged for a few minutes in the waters of this Mediterranean Sea. Such a name, surely, suited the sea better than any other.
          I returned and ate with a healthy appetite. Hans knew perfectly how to cook our limited menu; and was equipped with fire and water, so could vary our usual fare a little. With the pudding he served us cups of coffee, and never had this delicious beverage tasted better.
          ‘Now,’ said my uncle, ‘it’s time for the tide, and we must not miss the opportunity to study this phenomenon.’</p>

          <br>

        <p>‘What! A tide?’
          ‘Of course.’
          ‘Can the influence of the moon and the sun be felt down here then?’ ‘Why not? Are not all bodies subject to the force of gravity? This mass
          of water must therefore be subject to that universal law. So, despite the atmospheric pressure on the surface, you will see it rise like the Atlantic itself.’
          During this time we were walking along the sand, and the waves were creeping slowly up the shore.
          ‘Look, there’s the tide beginning,’ I cried.
          ‘Yes, Axel, and judging from the tidemark of foam, you can see that the water rises about ten feet.’
          ‘That’s fantastic!’
          ‘No, it’s natural.’</p>

          <br>

          <p>‘Say what you like, Uncle, this all seems extraordinary to me, and I
            can hardly believe my eyes. Who would ever have thought that there could be a real ocean inside the Earth’s crust, with its own ebb and flow, its own sea breezes and storms!’
            ‘And why not? Is there some physical reason to prevent it?’
            ‘Not that I can see, if we abandoned the theory of heat at the centre.’ ‘So up to this point Davy’s theory appears to be confirmed?’
            ‘It looks like it, and if that is the case there is nothing to oppose the
            existence of seas or lands inside the Earth.’
            ‘No doubt, but uninhabited.’
            ‘But why shouldn’t these waters shelter a few fish of some unknown
            species?’</p>

          <br>

          <p>‘Well at any rate we haven’t found a single one so far.’
            ‘We could rig up some lines and see if a hook has the same success here as in the sublunary oceans.’
            ‘We’ll try that, Axel, for we must unravel all the mysteries of these new territories.’
            ‘But where are we, Uncle? For I haven’t yet asked you that question, which the instruments must have answered for you.’
            ‘Horizontally, 880 miles from Iceland.’
            ‘As much as that?’
            ‘I think I am right to the nearest mile.’
            ‘And the compass is still pointing south-east?’
            ‘Yes, with a deviation to the west of 19° 42’, just like on the surface.
            As to its “dip” there is something very peculiar happening which I have been observing most carefully.’
            ‘Which is?’</p>

          <br>

          <p>‘The needle, instead of dipping towards the Pole as it does in the northern hemisphere, is pointing upwards instead.’
            ‘That means that the point of magnetic attraction lies somewhere be- tween the surface of the Earth and the place we have reached?’
            ‘Exactly, and it is quite probable that if we reached the polar regions, near the seventieth parallel where Sir James Ross86 discovered the mag- netic pole, we would see the needle point stand straight up. Therefore this mysterious centre of attraction is not located at any great depth.’
            ‘And that’s something that science has never even suspected.’
            ‘Science, my boy, is composed of errors, but errors that it is right to make, for they lead step by step towards the truth.’
            ‘How far down are we?’
            ‘Eighty-seven miles.’</p>

          <br>

          <p>‘So,’ I said, examining the map, ‘the Scottish Highlands are above us,
            and up there the snow-covered peaks of the Grampians are rising to pro- digious heights.’
            ‘Yes,’ replied the professor with a laugh, ‘it’s a bit heavy to hold up, but the vault is solid; the great architect of the universe built it of good firm stuff, and man would never have been able to give it such a span! What are bridge arches and cathedral vaults next to this nave forty miles in diameter, beneath which an ocean and its storms can behave as they wish?’
            ‘Oh, I’m not afraid of the sky falling on my head. Now, Uncle, what are your plans? Don’t you intend to go back to the surface of the Earth?’</p>

          <br>

          <p>‘Go back! What an idea. On the contrary, my intention is to continue our journey, since everything has gone so well to date.’
            ‘But I can’t see how we are going to find our path underneath that liq- uid plain.’
            ‘I have no intention of diving in head first. But if, properly speaking, oceans are nothing but lakes, since they are surrounded by land, then all the more reason for this inner sea to be surrounded by granite banks.’
            86 Sir James Ross: 1800–62, British naval officer, explorer of the Arctic and Antarctic; located the North Magnetic Pole in 1831.</p>

          <br>

          <p> ‘There’s no doubt about it.’ 87 ‘Well then! I’m sure to find other exits on the opposite shore.’ ‘So how long would you guess this ocean to be?’
            ‘Eighty or a hundred miles.’
            ‘Ah,’ I said, thinking to myself that this estimate could well be inaccu- rate.
            ‘Consequently we have no time to lose, and will set sail tomorrow.’
            I looked instinctively round for the ship which would carry us.
            ‘So,’ I said, ‘we’re going to embark. Good! And which ship are we to
            travel on?’
            ‘No ship, but a good solid raft.’
            ‘A raft!’ I cried. ‘A raft is just as impossible to build as a ship, and I
            can’t see. . . ’
            ‘You can’t see, Axel, but if you were listening you’d be able to hear!’ ‘Hear?’
            ‘Yes, hammer blows, which would tell you that Hans is already at
            work.’
            ‘Building a raft?’
            ‘Indeed.’</p>

          <br>

          <p>‘What! Has he already been chopping down trees?’
            ‘The trees were already down. Come along, and you will see him at it.’ Quarter of an hour’s walk later, I spotted Hans at work on the other
            side of the promontory which enclosed the small natural harbour. After a few more steps I was beside him. To my astonishment, a half-finished raft lay on the sand; it was made from timbers of a distinctive wood, and a great number of beams, knees, and frames were strewn over the ground. There was enough material there to construct an entire fleet.
            ‘Uncle,’ I cried, ‘what wood is this?’
            ‘Pine, fir, birch, all sorts of northern conifers, petrified by the sea wa- ter.’
            ‘Is that possible?’</p>

          <br>

          <p>‘It is what is called surtarbrandur, or fossilised wood.’
            ‘In that case, like lignite, it must be as hard as stone, and unable to
            float.’
            ‘Sometimes that is the case: some of the woods have become true an-
            thracites; but others, such as these, have only just begun to be trans- formed into fossils. Watch this,’ added my uncle, throwing one of the pre- cious spars into the sea.
            The piece of wood disappeared for a moment, then bobbed up again to the surface of the water to float up and down following its movements.
            ‘Are you convinced?’ said my uncle.
            ‘Convinced that what I see is incredible!’
            By the following evening, thanks to Hans’s skill, the raft was finished;</p>

          <br>

          <p>it was ten feet long by five feet wide; the beams of surtarbrandur, bound together with stout ropes, formed a solid surface. Once it had been
            87 opposite shore: Verne here quickly skips over the fact that there is little logical reason to cross the sea.

            launched, the improvised vessel floated serenely on the waters of the Li- denbrock Sea.</p>
