        <h2>Chapter 32</h2>

        <p>On 13 August we woke up early. We were now going to inaugurate this new sort of transport, fast and not too tiring.
          A mast made of two pieces of wood fastened together, a yard made from another, and a sail borrowed from our blankets made up the rigging of our raft. There was no lack of rope. The whole thing was solid.
          At six o’clock the professor gave the signal to embark. Our provisions, luggage, instruments, and weapons, along with a good supply of fresh water collected among the rocks, were already on board.
          Hans had fitted a rudder which allowed him to steer the floating construction. He took the helm. I unhitched the mooring line attaching us to shore. The sail was trimmed, and we set off at a rate of knots.
          As we were leaving the little harbour, my uncle, who was very at- tached to his geographic nomenclature, decided to give it a name and proposed mine, amongst others.
          ‘Well, I have another to suggest.’
          ‘And what’s that?’
          ‘Gräuben’s. Port Gräuben will look very good on the map.’
          ‘Port Gräuben it is.’</p>

        <br>

        <p>And that was how the memory of my dear Virland girl became linked
          to our adventurous expedition.
          The wind was blowing from the north-east. We ran before the wind at a
          good speed. The very dense atmospheric layers had great propulsive power and acted on the sail like a powerful fan.
          After an hour, my uncle had been able to estimate our speed relatively precisely.
          ‘If we continue to advance at the present rate,’ he said, ‘we will cover at least eighty miles every twenty-four hours, and it won’t be too long be- fore we reach the opposite shore.’
          I did not reply, and made my way to the front of the raft. The north- ern coastline was already disappearing behind the horizon. The two limbs of the shore were spread wide apart, as if to assist our departure. An im- mense ocean stretched before my eyes. Massive clouds scooted along, casting their grey shadows on the surface; shadows which seemed to weigh down upon that dismal water. The silvery rays of electric light, re- flected here and there by drops of spray, picked out glittering points in the vessel’</p>

        <br>

        <p>We were soon out of sight of land, without any point of refer- ence, and had it not been for the frothy wake of the raft, I could have be- lieved that we were totally motionless.
          At about midday, immense patches of algae appeared, floating on the surface of the waves. I was aware of the extraordinarily prolific power of these plants, which creep along the bottom of the sea at a depth of more than twelve thousand feet, reproduce under pressures of four hundred
          atmospheres, and often form masses large enough to impede the pro- gress of ships. But there can never, I believe, have existed algae as gi- gantic as those of the Lidenbrock Sea.
          Our raft swept along beside pieces of seaweed some three to four thousand feet in length, immense snakes which stretched out far beyond our horizon; it gave me great amusement to gaze along their infinite rib- bon-like lengths, thinking each moment that I had reached the end. Hour after hour passed. If my astonishment increased, my patience was well- nigh exhausted.
          What natural force could have produced such plants? What must the Earth have looked like during the first centuries of its formation when, acted upon by heat and humidity, the vegetable kingdom was developing solitarily on its surface?</p>

        <br>

        <p>Night came, but, as I had noticed the evening before, the luminosity of the atmosphere did not reduce at all. It was a consistent phenomenon whose permanence we could count on.
          After supper, I stretched out at the foot of the mast, and soon, idly dreaming, fell asleep.
          Hans, motionless at the tiller, let the raft run. As the wind was aft, he did not even have to steer it.
          On leaving Port Gräuben, Professor Lidenbrock had given me the job of keeping the ‘ship’s log’, with instructions to put down even the most trivial observations, to note interesting phenomena, the direction of the wind, our speed, the distance covered: in a word, every incident of our fantastic voyage.</p>

        <br>

        <p>I will confine myself, therefore, to reproducing here those daily notes, written, as it were, at the dictation of events, in order to give a more pre- cise account of our crossing.
          Friday, 14 August. Steady breeze from the NW. Raft progressing with extreme rapidity, going perfectly straight. Coast about eighty miles to leeward. Nothing on the horizon. The intensity of the light never varies. Weather fine; i.e. the clouds are very high, light, and fleecy, and floating in an atmosphere resembling molten silver. Thermometer: 32°C.
          At midday Hans ties a hook to the end of a line. He baits it with a small piece of meat and casts it into the sea. He doesn’t catch anything for two hours. Are there no fish in this sea? But yes, there is a tug on the line. Hans draws it in, and then pulls out a fish, which is wriggling furious- ly.
          ‘A fish!’ cries my uncle.</p>

        <br>

        <p>‘A sturgeon!’ I shout in turn, ‘Definitely a small sturgeon!’
          The professor is examining the animal carefully, and he does not
          agree with me. This fish has a flattened, curved head, and the lower parts of its body are covered with bony plates; its mouth is wholly without teeth; quite well-developed pectoral fins are fitted to its tailless body. This animal certainly belongs to the order in which naturalists classify the sturgeon, but it differs from that fish in many quite basic details.
          My uncle is not mistaken, after all. Following a short examination he says:
          ‘This fish belongs to a family which has been extinct for centuries, and of which only fossil traces remain, in the Devonian strata.’</p>

        <br>

        <p>‘What! Have we really captured alive an authentic inhabitant of the primitive seas?’
          ‘We have,’ said the professor, continuing his observation, ‘and you may notice that these fossil fish are distinct from any existing species. To hold a living specimen of the order in one’s hand is a great joy for a natu- ralist.’
          ‘But what family does it belong to?’
          ‘To the order of ganoids, family of the Cephalaspis, genus. . . ’
          ‘Well?’
          ‘Genus Pterychtis, I would swear to it. But this fish displays a peculiar-
          ity, which is apparently encountered in the fish of underground waters.’ ‘Which one?’
          ‘It is blind.’
          ‘Amazing!</p>

        <br>

        <p>‘Not only blind, but absolutely without organs of sight.’
          I look. It really is true. This, however, may be an isolated instance. So
          the hook is baited again and thrown back into the water. The ocean must be well stocked with fish, for in two hours we take a large number of
          Pterychtis, as well as fish belonging 88 to another extinct family—the Dipterides,
          though my uncle cannot classify them exactly. All are eyeless. This unexpected catch fortunately
          renews our stock of provisions.
          It now seems very probable that this sea contains only fossil species—
          in which both fish and reptiles alike are more perfect the longer ago they were created.
          Perhaps we are going to find some of those saurians which science has succeeded in recreating from bits of bone or cartilage?</p>

        <br>

        <p>I take the telescope and examine the sea. It is deserted. Doubtless we are still too near the coast.
          I look up. Why should not some of the birds reconstructed by the im- mortal Cuvier89 be flapping their wings in the heavy strata of the atmos- phere? The fish would provide quite sufficient food. I search the space above, but the airs are as uninhabited as the shores.
          Nevertheless, my imagination carries me away into the fantastic hy- potheses of palaeontology. I am in a waking dream. I fancy I can see on the surface of the water those enormous Chersites, tortoises from before the flood, as big as floating islands. Along the darkened shores are pass-
          88 Dipterides: a genus of fish with only two fins.</p>
