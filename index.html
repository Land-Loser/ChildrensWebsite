        <p>Journey to the Center of the Earth (French: Voyage au centre de la Terre, also translated under the titles A Journey to the Centre of the Earth and A Journey to the Interior of the Earth) is an 1864 science fiction novel by <span>Jules Verne</span>. The story involves German professor Otto Lidenbrock who believes there are volcanic tubes going toward the centre of the Earth. He, his nephew Axel, and their guide Hans descend into the Icelandic volcano Snæfellsjökull, encountering many adventures, including prehistoric animals and natural hazards, before eventually coming to the surface again in southern Italy, at the Stromboli volcano.</p>
        <p>The genre of subterranean fiction already existed long before Verne. However, the present book considerably added to its popularity and influenced later such writings. For example, Edgar Rice Burroughs explicitly acknowledged Verne's influence on his own Pellucidar series.</p>

        <h2 class="mainHeading">ABOUT  THE  AUTHOR</h2>
        <p>Jules Gabriel <span>Verne</span> (8 February 1828 – 24 March 1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright.</p>
        <p>Verne was born in the seaport of Nantes, where he was trained to follow in his father's footsteps as a lawyer, but quit the profession early in life to write for magazines and the stage. His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the Voyages extraordinaires, a widely popular series of scrupulously researched adventure novels including Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870), and Around the World in Eighty Days (1873).</p>
        <p>Verne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism. His reputation is markedly different in Anglophone regions, where he has often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children's books, largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations.</p>

        <p>I woke up the next day completely cured. I thought a bathe would do me a lot of good, and so went and plunged for a few minutes in the waters of this Mediterranean Sea. Such a name, surely, suited the sea better than any other.</p>
        <p>I returned and ate with a healthy appetite. Hans knew perfectly how to cook our limited menu; and was equipped with fire and water, so could vary our usual fare a little. With the pudding he served us cups of coffee, and never had this delicious beverage tasted better.</p>
        <p>Now, said my uncle, ‘it’s time for the tide, and we must not miss the opportunity to study this phenomenon.’
          ‘What! A tide?'
          ‘Of course.’
          ‘Can the influence of the moon and the sun be felt down here then?’ ‘Why not? Are not all bodies subject to the force of gravity? This mass
          of water must therefore be subject to that universal law. So, despite the atmospheric pressure on the surface, you will see it rise like the Atlantic itself.’</p>
          <br>

        <p>During this time we were walking along the sand, and the waves were creeping slowly up the shore.
        ‘Look, there’s the tide beginning,’ I cried.
        ‘Yes, Axel, and judging from the tidemark of foam, you can see that the water rises about ten feet.’</p>
        <p>‘That’s fantastic!’
          ‘No, it’s natural.’
          ‘Say what you like, Uncle, this all seems extraordinary to me, and I
          can hardly believe my eyes. Who would ever have thought that there could be a real ocean inside the Earth’s crust, with its own ebb and flow, its own sea breezes and storms!’
          'And why not? Is there some physical reason to prevent it?’</p>
        <p>‘Not that I can see, if we abandoned the theory of heat at the centre.’ ‘So up to this point Davy’s theory appears to be confirmed?’
            ‘It looks like it, and if that is the case there is nothing to oppose the
            existence of seas or lands inside the Earth.’
            ‘No doubt, but uninhabited.’
            ‘But why shouldn’t these waters shelter a few fish of some unknown
            species?’
            ‘Well at any rate we haven’t found a single one so far.’
            ‘We could rig up some lines and see if a hook has the same success here as in the sublunary oceans.’
            ‘We’ll try that, Axel, for we must unravel all the mysteries of these new territories.’</p>

        <p>On 13 August we woke up early. We were now going to inaugurate this new sort of transport, fast and not too tiring.</p>
        <p>A mast made of two pieces of wood fastened together, a yard made from another, and a sail borrowed from our blankets made up the rigging of our raft. There was no lack of rope. The whole thing was solid.</p>
        <p>At six o’clock the professor gave the signal to embark. Our provisions, luggage, instruments, and weapons, along with a good supply of fresh water collected among the rocks, were already on board.</p>
        <p>Hans had fitted a rudder which allowed him to steer the floating construction. He took the helm. I unhitched the mooring line attaching us to shore. The sail was trimmed, and we set off at a rate of knots.</p>

        <p>As we were leaving the little harbour, my uncle, who was very at- tached to his geographic nomenclature, decided to give it a name and proposed mine, amongst others.
          ‘Well, I have another to suggest.’
          ‘And what’s that?’
          ‘Gräuben’s. Port Gräuben will look very good on the map.’
          ‘Port Gräuben it is.’
          And that was how the memory of my dear Virland girl became linked
          to our adventurous expedition.</p>
        <p>The wind was blowing from the north-east. We ran before the wind at a
            good speed. The very dense atmospheric layers had great propulsive power and acted on the sail like a powerful fan.</p>
        <p>After an hour, my uncle had been able to estimate our speed relatively precisely.
            ‘If we continue to advance at the present rate,’ he said, ‘we will cover at least eighty miles every twenty-four hours, and it won’t be too long be- fore we reach the opposite shore.’</p>
        <p>I did not reply, and made my way to the front of the raft. The north- ern coastline was already disappearing behind the horizon. The two limbs of the shore were spread wide apart, as if to assist our departure.</p>
